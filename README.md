# K2-T2

**Contributors:** Angie, Cha Cha, Mira, Lindsey

This is an RA Project focused on exploring data analysis in R. We are using the K-2 Timepoint 2 behavioral data, which was collected remotely via Zoom.

## Objectives:
* Explore the T2 remote data, similar to what Lindsey did in T1 to present to Synapse (descriptive stats, plots, etc.)
* Explore T1-T2 correlations
* Think about how we can make sense of T2 scores, considering remote assessment differences
* Use this as an opportunity to learn and explore R

## Materials

## Progress

*July 23, 2020* - Walkthrough of the R [script](https://github.com/lrhasak/K2-Project) used for T1 behavioral data analysis, which was focused on presenting visualizations to Synapse.

*July 31, 2020* - Basics of manipulating tidy data in R. Create new T2 script and begin loading and cleaning the data.
