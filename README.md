# K-2 T1-T2 Behavioral Data

**Contributors:** Angie, Cha Cha, Mira, Lindsey

This is an RA Project focused on exploring data analysis in R and presenting data back to a Synapse audience.

## Objectives:
* Explore the T2 remote data, similar to what Lindsey did in T1 to present to Synapse (descriptive stats, plots, etc.)
* Explore T1-T2 relationships
* Construct visualizations to present to Synapse
* Use this as an opportunity to learn and improve R skills

## Materials

## Progress

*July 23, 2020* - Walkthrough of the R [script](https://github.com/lrhasak/K2-Project) used for T1 behavioral data analysis, which was focused on presenting visualizations to Synapse.

*July 31, 2020* - Basics of manipulating tidy data in R. Created new T2 script and began loading and cleaning the data. 

*August 6, 2020* - Continue with dplyr verbs. Added exercises (solutions added 8/11).

*August 14, 2020* - ggplot basics.

*September 2020* - Incorporate T1 data.

*October 2020* - Refine T1-T2 visualizations for Synapse audience.
